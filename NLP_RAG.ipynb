If the perforation is contained by the omentum, an appendiceal abscess results.\n","Symptoms and Signs\n","The classic symptoms of acute appendicitis are epigastric or periumbilical pain followed by brief nausea,\n","vomiting, and anorexia; after a few hours, the pain shifts to the right lower quadrant. Pain increases with\n","cough and motion. Classic signs are right lower quadrant direct and rebound tenderness located at\n","McBurney's point (junction of the middle and outer thirds of the line joining the umbilicus to the anterior\n","superior spine). Additional signs are pain felt in the right lower quadrant with palpation of the left lower\n","quadrant (Rovsing sign), an increase in pain from passive extension of the right hip joint that stretches\n","the iliopsoas muscle (psoas sign), or pain caused by passive internal rotation of the flexed thigh\n","(obturator sign). Low-grade fever (rectal temperature 37.7 to 38.3° C [100 to 101° F]) is common.\n","Unfortunately, these classic findings appear in < 50% of patients. Many variations of symptoms and signs\n","occur. Pain may not be localized, particularly in infants and children. Tenderness may be diffuse or, in rare\n","instances, absent.

In such patients, delaying\n","laparotomy to do imaging tests only increases the likelihood of perforation and subsequent complications.\n","In patients with atypical or equivocal findings, imaging studies should be done without delay. Contrast-\n","enhanced CT has reasonable accuracy in diagnosing appendicitis and can also reveal other causes of\n","an acute abdomen. Graded compression ultrasound can usually be done quickly and uses no radiation\n","(of particular concern in children); however, it is occasionally limited by the presence of bowel gas and is\n","less useful for recognizing nonappendiceal causes of pain.

The obstruction leads to\\ndistention, bacterial overgrowth, ischemia, and inflammation. If untreated, necrosis, gangrene, and\\nperforation occur. If the perforation is contained by the omentum, an appendiceal abscess results.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nThe classic symptoms of acute appendicitis are epigastric or periumbilical pain followed by brief nausea,\\nvomiting, and anorexia; after a few hours, the pain shifts to the right lower quadrant. Pain increases with\\ncough and motion. Classic signs are right lower quadrant direct and rebound tenderness located at\\nMcBurney's point (junction of the middle and outer thirds of the line joining the umbilicus to the anterior\\nsuperior spine). Additional signs are pain felt in the right lower quadrant with palpation of the left lower\\nquadrant (Rovsing sign), an increase in pain from passive extension of the right hip joint that stretches\\nthe iliopsoas muscle (psoas sign), or pain caused by passive internal rotation of the flexed thigh\\n(obturator sign). Low-grade fever (rectal temperature 37.7 to 38.3° C [100 to 101° F]) is common.\\nUnfortunately, these classic findings appear in < 50% of patients. Many variations of symptoms and signs\\noccur. Pain may not be localized, particularly in infants and children. Tenderness may be diffuse or, in rare\\ninstances, absent. Bowel movements are usually less frequent or absent; if diarrhea is a sign, a\\nretrocecal appendix should be suspected. RBCs or WBCs may be present in the urine. Atypical symptoms\\nare common among elderly patients and pregnant women; in particular, pain is less severe and local\\ntenderness is less marked.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Clinical evaluation\\n• Abdominal CT if necessary\\n• Ultrasound an option to CT\\nWhen classic symptoms and signs are present, the diagnosis is clinical. In such patients, delaying\\nlaparotomy to do imaging tests only increases the likelihood of perforation and subsequent complications.\\nIn patients with atypical or equivocal findings, imaging studies should be done without delay. Contrast-\\nenhanced CT has reasonable accuracy in diagnosing appendicitis and can also reveal other causes of\\nan acute abdomen. Graded compression ultrasound can usually be done quickly and uses no radiation\\n(of particular concern in children); however, it is occasionally limited by the presence of bowel gas and is\\nless useful for recognizing nonappendiceal causes of pain. Appendicitis remains primarily a clinical\\ndiagnosis. Selective and judicious use of radiographic studies may reduce the rate of negative\\nlaparotomy.\\nLaparoscopy can be used for diagnosis as well as definitive treatment; it may be especially helpful in\\nwomen with lower abdominal pain of unclear etiology. Laboratory studies typically show leukocytosis\\n(12,000 to 15,000/μL), but this finding is highly variable; a normal WBC count should not be used to\\nexclude appendicitis.\\nPrognosis\\nWithout surgery or antibiotics, mortality is > 50%.\\nWith early surgery, the mortality rate is < 1%, and convalescence is normally rapid and complete. With\\ncomplications (rupture and development of an abscess or peritonitis), the prognosis is worse: Repeat\\noperations and a long convalescence may follow.\\nTreatment\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition\\nChapter 11.

Specific questions are most likely to be\\naddressed in the medical literature. A well-designed question specifies the population, intervention\\n(diagnostic test, treatment), comparison (treatment A vs treatment B), and outcome. \"What is the best way\\nto evaluate someone with abdominal pain?\" is not a good question. A better, more specific question may\\nbe \"Is CT or ultrasonography preferable for diagnosing acute appendicitis in a 30-yr-old male with acute\\nlower abdominal pain?\"\\nGathering evidence to answer the question: A broad selection of relevant studies is obtained from a\\nreview of the literature. Standard resources are consulted (eg, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Collaboration\\n[treatment options], the National Guideline Clearinghouse, ACP Journal Club).\\nEvaluating the quality and validity of the evidence: Not all scientific studies are of equal value.\\nDifferent types of studies have different scientific strengths and legitimacy, and for any given type of\\nstudy, individual examples often vary in quality of the methodology, internal validity, and generalizability of\\nresults (external validity).\\nLevels of evidence are graded 1 through 5 in decreasing order of quality. Types of studies at each level\\nvary somewhat with the clinical question (eg, of diagnosis, treatment, or economic analysis), but typically\\nlevel 1 evidence (the highest quality) consists of systematic reviews or meta-analyses of randomized\\ncontrolled trials and high-quality, single, randomized controlled trials. Level 2 evidence is well-designed\\ncohort studies. Level 3 evidence is case-control studies. Level 4 evidence is case series and poor-quality\\ncohort and case-control studies. Level 5 evidence is expert opinion not based on critical appraisal but is\\nbased on reasoning from physiology, bench research, or underlying principles.\\nFor EBM analysis, the highest level of evidence available is selected. Ideally, a significant number of\\nlarge, well-conducted level 1 studies are available. However, because the number of high-quality,\\nrandomized, controlled trials is vanishingly small compared with the number of possible clinical questions,\\nless reliable level 4 or 5 evidence is very often all that is available. Lower-quality evidence does not mean\\nthat the EBM process cannot be followed, just that the strength of the conclusion is weaker.\\nDeciding how to apply the evidence to the care of a given patient: Because the best available\\nevidence may have come from patient populations with different characteristics from those of the patient\\nin question, some judgment is required. Additionally, patients\\' wishes regarding aggressive or invasive\\ntests and treatment must be taken into account as well as their tolerance for discomfort, risk, and\\nuncertainty. For example, even though an EBM review may definitively show a 3-mo survival advantage\\nfrom an aggressive chemotherapy regimen in a certain form of cancer, patients may differ on whether\\nthey prefer to gain the extra time or avoid the extra discomfort.\\nLimitations: Dozens of clinical questions are faced during the course of even one day in a busy practice.\\nAlthough some of them may be the subject of an existing EBM review available for reference, most are\\nnot, and preparing an EBM analysis is too time-consuming to be useful in answering an immediate clinical\\nquestion. Even when time is not a consideration, many clinical questions do not have any relevant studies\\nin the literature.\\nClinical Guidelines\\nClinical guidelines have become common in the practice of medicine; many specialty societies have\\npublished such guidelines. Most well-conceived clinical guidelines are developed using a specified\\nmethod that incorporates principles of EBM and consensus recommendations made by a panel of\\nexperts.\\nSome clinical guidelines follow \"if, then\" rules (eg, if a patient is febrile and neutropenic, then institute\\nbroad-spectrum antibiotics). More complex, multistep rules may be formalized as algorithms. Guidelines\\nand algorithms are generally straightforward and easy to use but should be applied only to patients\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition\\nChapter 342.
